# Smoke-and-Fire-Detector---Arduino-
As we all know, architecture represents the accomplishment, wealth, and creativity of a city or a nation. No one wants to afford damage to them. Fire accident is one of the major cause which harms not only buildings but also human beings. The most usual causes of house fires are electrical distribution, lighting systems, cooking, Etc. In this technological era, the use of engineering is the best way to avoid such accidents. Today, we will build an interesting project using Arduino. Fire alarm detection project demonstrates the use of Arduino to build a fire detection system using the sensors which measure temperature of the environment. The fire alarm detection system remains idle unless there is a fire outbreak. The system in idle condition glows green LED.
